# BigThinkAI Workshops

Welcome to my BigThinkAI workshops repository!!  
This repo contains a collection of AI/ML workshops I've helped create and lead as the AI Lead for [BigTh!nkAI @ UMD](https://terplink.umd.edu/organization/bigthinkai).

Our goal is to make artificial intelligence accessible ‚Äî whether you're just starting out or diving into cutting-edge topics. These workshops span beginner to advanced levels and are structured with **Colab notebooks, slides, and interactive demos**.

And so I hope this repo serves as another way for people to access our resources and learn about our club, and also showcase some of the cool workshops I've helped run!
