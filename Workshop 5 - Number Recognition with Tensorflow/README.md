## What It Covers
- **What is a Neural Network?**  
  Learn about layers, weights, neurons, and activation functions in detail
- **Building Dense Networks**  
  Train and compare simple models with 128 and 2048 neurons
- **Training Loops & Optimization**  
  Understand epochs, batches, forward and backward propagation
- **Intro to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
  Learn why CNNs are better for image data â€” and build one yourself!
  Deep dive into each layer of CNNs, including Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, BatchNormalization, Dropout, Flatten, Dense layers!
